There are five important features of GA: Encoding possible solutions of a problem are considered as individuals in a population. If the solutions can be divided into a series of small steps (building blocks), then these steps are represented by genes and a series of genes (a chromosome) will encode the whole solution. This way different solutions of a problem are represented in GA as chromosomes of individuals. Fitness Function represents the main requirements of the desired solution of a problem (i.e. cheapest price, shortest route, most compact arrangement, etc). This function calculates and returns the fitness of an individual solution. Selection operator defines the way individuals in the current population are selected for reproduction. There are many strategies for that (e.g. roulette–wheel, ranked, tournament selection, etc), but usually the individuals which are more fit are selected.\n",

    "Crossover operator defines how chromosomes of parents are mixed in order to obtain genetic codes of their offspring (e.g. one–point, two–point, uniform crossover, etc). This operator implements the inheritance property (offspring inherit genes of their parents). Mutation operator creates random changes in genetic codes of the offspring. This operator is needed to bring some random diversity into the genetic code. In some cases GA cannot find the optimal solution without mutation operator (local maximum problem)."
